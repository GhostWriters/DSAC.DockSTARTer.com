You may choose to rely on DSAC for various changes to your Docker system, or use it as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations and connecting applications together. Getting Started System Requirements We maintain the same system requirement as DockSTARTer . You can find the DockSTARTer System Requirements here TL;DR: You must be running a Supported platform or an operating system based on a supported platform. Platforms named below will link to documentation listing compatible versions. You must be logged in as a non-root user with sudo permissions. One Time Setup (required) APT Systems ( Debian , Ubuntu , etc) sudo apt-get install curl git bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://ghostwriters.github.io/DSAC/main.sh)\" sudo reboot Raspbian requires a few extra commands sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade sudo apt-get install curl git bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com)\" bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://ghostwriters.github.io/DSAC/main.sh)\" sudo reboot DNF Systems ( Fedora ) sudo dnf install curl git bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://ghostwriters.github.io/DSAC/main.sh)\" sudo reboot YUM Systems ( CentOS ) sudo yum install curl git bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://ghostwriters.github.io/DSAC/main.sh)\" sudo reboot Alternate install (any system) The standard install above downloads the initial script using a method with some known risks. For those concerned with the security of the above method here is an alternative: ## NOTE: Run the appropriate command for your distro sudo apt-get install curl git sudo dnf install curl git sudo yum install curl git ## NOTE: Do not sudo the next line. git clone https://github.com/GhostWriters/DSAC.git \"/home/${USER}/.dsac\" sudo bash /home/${USER}/.dsac/main.sh -vi sudo reboot Running DSAC sudo dsac To run DSAC use the command above.

DSAC can be operated through a friendly GUI of terminal menus. DSAC can be operated through commands for more advanced users who do not prefer the GUI. DSAC gives you the freedom to choose what you want to run. DSAC comes with optional menu options to run various types of apps using DockSTARTer. What DockSTARTer App Config (aka DSAC) Is Not DSAC is not a premade set of apps that run an exact way (you get to choose what to run and how to run it). DSAC does not override you current app configurations, if you have any running. Anything added is done so with \"DSAC\" as part of the name. DSAC does not configure storage for you (you may use local storage, or cloud storage, multiple disks, raid, etc). DSAC does not require the use of DockSTARTer, though it uses it for some of the menu options. Recommended Reading Since much of this is based around DockSTARTer, it is recommended that you head over to DockSTARTer and read about it.

DSAC will then run DockSTARTer to install Docker, Docker Compose, and docker configurations for these apps. By default, all the app types are selected. Running it like this will give you a media setup with apps that are connected together. All you will have to do is configure the applications to your liking. Note that this (currently) does not include a media streaming app like Plex, Emby, or anthing else. You can run sudo ds , choose \"Configuration\", then choose \"Select Apps\", to have those setup for you to use. Custom Setup The \"Custom Setup\" menu option will allow you to select apps you want to run. DSAC will then run DockSTARTer to install Docker, Docker Compose, and docker configurations for these apps. Any apps that DSAC supports will have \"(DSAC Supported)\" at the beginning of its description. If you select two that can be linked together, DSAC will handle adding those links to the applications. In addition, if you ever want to remove an application, you can use this option to deselect an app, and it will be removed for you.
