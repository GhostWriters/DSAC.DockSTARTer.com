# Introduction

## What DockSTARTer App Config (aka DSAC) Is

- DSAC is a script that helps to connect supported Docker Applications together.
- DSAC can be operated through a friendly GUI of terminal menus.
- DSAC can be operated through commands for more advanced users who do not prefer the GUI.
- DSAC gives you the freedom to choose what you want to run.
- DSAC comes with optional menu options to run various types of apps using DockSTARTer.

## What DockSTARTer App Config (aka DSAC) Is Not

- DSAC is not a premade set of apps that run an exact way (you get to choose what to run and how to run it).
- DSAC does not override you current app configurations, if you have any running. Anything added is done so with "DSAC" as part of the name.
- DSAC does not configure storage for you (you may use local storage, or cloud storage, multiple disks, raid, etc).
- DSAC does not require the use of DockSTARTer, though it uses it for some of the menu options.
